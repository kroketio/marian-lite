// The simplest (and recommended) way to handle signals is to simply set a flag
// in the signal handler and check that flag later.
//
// We provide setSignalFlag as the most generic signal handler. This handler uses a
// single sig_atomic_t as a bit field. On Linux, sig_atomic_t is equivalent to a signed int,
// theoretically providing 32 binary flags; in practice, most likely signals for which we may
// want to install signal handlers are
// - SIGTERM (15): which by default signals the request for a graceful shutdown
// - SIGUSR1 (10): intended for custom use, default action in Linux is termination
// - SIGUSR2 (12): intended for custom use, default action in Linux is termination
// - SIGINT (2): interrupt from the console
// Just to be safe, we accommodate signals up to signal No. 30.

// In addition, we also provide requestSaveAndExit() and saveAndExit() as a signal
// handler/checker for graceful shutdown requests during training.
constexpr int maxSignalForSetSignalFlag{30};

// Make sure sig_atomic_t is large enough as a bit field for our purposes.
// That said, I'm not aware of any platform where this would be a problem.
